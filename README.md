# MERN_Todo_Backend

<p>Developed a feature-rich Todo List application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, incorporating comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. Implemented an intuitive user interface that allows users to efficiently manage and prioritize their tasks, promoting productivity and organization.

what I have done in the project:

1. Designed and developed the front end using React.js, creating a user-friendly interface with smooth navigation and interactive components.
2. Implemented RESTful APIs in the backend using Express.js, providing endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks.
3. Utilized MongoDB as the database to store and manage task-related data, ensuring efficient retrieval and persistence.
4. Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to enable users to add new tasks, view existing ones, update task details, and mark tasks as completed.
5. Incorporated a popup interface for adding new tasks, and enhancing user experience and interaction.
6. Utilized asynchronous fetch requests to communicate with the backend API endpoints and update the UI with the fetched data.
7. Styled the application using CSS and CSS variables, creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
8. Implemented responsive design techniques, ensuring the application is accessible and functional on various devices and screen sizes.
9. Conducted testing and debugging to identify and resolve any issues or errors, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience.
10. Deployed the application on a hosting platform for public access, allowing users to access and utilize the Todo List application.
